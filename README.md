## Theremin
Experience the magic of the world's only touchless instrument right in your browser. EtherWave uses advanced computer vision to track your hand movements in real-time, allowing you to conjure music from thin air—just like a classic 1920s Theremin. No cables, no hardware, just you and the music.

How to Play:

👋 Right Hand (Pitch): Move your hand Left/Right to change the musical note.

👋 Left Hand (Volume): Move your hand Up/Down to control the intensity.

Key Features:

Powered by AI: Built with Google MediaPipe for high-speed, accurate hand tracking.

Custom Soundscapes: Choose from 4 waveforms (Sine, Square, Sawtooth, Triangle).

Atmospheric Effects: Add a "Spooky" delay and reverb for that classic sci-fi movie sound.

Retro Visuals: A real-time oscilloscope and neon laboratory interface.
